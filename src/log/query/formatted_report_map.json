"- [Score: 95] The network system is designed for high-performance storage infrastructure, involving dedicated Top-of-Rack (ToR) leaf switches and a NAS/SAN Target storage server.\n- [Score: 90] Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000) are consistently configured across storage leaf switches, storage server interfaces, and uplinks to optimize high-throughput data transfer.\n- [Score: 90] LACP (802.3ad) bonding is utilized on both the storage leaf switches (BOND_TOR_STORAGE) and the high-performance storage server ('bond0_storage') for redundancy and load balancing.\n- [Score: 85] VLAN 30 (VLAN30_SAN / bond0.30) is dedicated for SAN traffic, operating within the 172.16.30.0/24 IP subnet.\n- [Score: 80] The 'HIGH-PERFORMANCE STORAGE SERVER' (NAS/SAN Target) has the IP address 172.16.30.10 and uses 'eno1' and 'eno2' interfaces in its LACP bond.\n- [Score: 80] The storage infrastructure uses two redundant Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, STORAGE LEAF 01 and 02, which act as a next-hop gateway at 172.16.30.253 for the SAN subnet.\n- [Score: 70] The storage leaf switches connect to the core network via uplinks (ETH_UPLINK_SPINE2) which are also configured with high MTU."
