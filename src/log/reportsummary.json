  "Dedicated high-performance storage server (Node 7) acting as a NAS/SAN target.",
  "Utilizes 802.3ad LACP bonding for network redundancy and potential throughput aggregation.",
  "Configured for Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000) across all relevant interfaces, optimizing storage traffic.",
  "Storage traffic is isolated on VLAN 30 (172.16.30.10/24) for security and performance.",
  "DHCPv4 is disabled on physical interfaces, indicating static IP configuration.",
  "Redundant Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches dedicated to storage (STORAGE LEAF 01 & 02).",
  "Optimized for Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000) for efficient storage data transfer.",
  "Uses 802.3ad LACP bonding for server downlinks, enhancing resilience.",
  "Dedicated VLAN 30 for SAN traffic (172.16.30.253/24).",
  "Uplinks to a spine network (e.g., 10.0.11.2/30) for broader network connectivity.",
  "DHCPv4 is disabled on physical interfaces, indicating static IP configuration.",
  "Dedicated compute hypervisor (Node 8) for hosting VMs/Containers.",
  "Utilizes 802.3ad LACP bonding for network redundancy and throughput.",
  "Network traffic is segmented using VLANs (VLAN 10 for management, VLAN 20 for VM data).",
  "A Linux bridge ('br_vm_data') is used for VM network connectivity, with STP disabled.",
  "DHCPv4 is disabled on physical interfaces, indicating static IP configuration.",
  "Redundant Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches dedicated to compute servers (COMPUTE LEAF 01 & 02).",
  "Uses 802.3ad LACP bonding with fast LACP for server downlinks, enhancing resilience and rapid failure detection.",
  "Provides network segmentation with VLAN 10 for management and VLAN 20 for VM traffic.",
  "Uplinks to a spine network (e.g., 10.0.1.2/30).",
  "Acts as a routing point for the compute cluster, indicated by the 0.0.0.0/0 destination network.",
  "DHCPv4 is disabled on physical interfaces, indicating static IP configuration.",
  "Provides redundant WAN gateway functionality for internet access.",
  "Connects the internal network to the public internet.",
  "Routes traffic to the 172.16.0.0/16 internal destination network.",
  "Utilizes /30 subnets for point-to-point links to the spine layer, indicating direct connections to core routers.",
  "Part of the redundant L3 core network, providing high availability.",
  "Connects to an edge router (likely EDGE ROUTER 02) and multiple leaf routers.",
  "Supports jumbo frames (MTU 9000) on leaf-facing interfaces, indicating high-performance links to the access layer.",
  "Acts as an aggregation point for traffic from the access layer towards the edge.",
  "Part of the high-performance L3 core network.",
  "Connects to an edge router (likely EDGE ROUTER 01) and multiple leaf routers.",
  "Supports jumbo frames (MTU 9000) on leaf-facing interfaces for optimized data transfer.",
  "Routes traffic to specific internal destination networks (172.16.20.0/24, 172.16.30.0/24).",
  "Acts as a next-hop for other internal segments, suggesting complex routing logic or inter-spine awareness."
