    "title": "High-Performance Storage Server Connectivity",
    "summary": "This community is centered around a 'HIGH-PERFORMANCE STORAGE SERVER' identified as a NAS/SAN Target. It utilizes a robust network configuration featuring an 802.3ad LACP bond ('bond0_storage') for redundancy and load balancing across two physical Ethernet interfaces ('eno1', 'eno2'). All interfaces involved in the storage connectivity are configured with an MTU of 9000 bytes (Jumbo Frames), indicating a design for high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. A VLAN interface ('bond0.30') with ID 30 provides network access for the server within the 172.16.30.0/24 subnet, with the server's IP being 172.16.30.10. A next-hop gateway at 172.16.30.253 is also present within this subnet.",

    "rating_explanation": "This community involves a high-performance storage server, which is typically a critical component in any network infrastructure, supporting essential applications, databases, or virtualized environments. Its availability and performance are paramount for business operations. The use of LACP bonding and jumbo frames further emphasizes its role in handling high-throughput, low-latency traffic, making it a high-risk/high-importance asset.",

    "title": "Spine Router 02 - Core Connectivity",
    "summary": "This community describes 'SPINE ROUTER 02,' identified as a 'Redundant L3 Core, Node 2.' This device serves as a core routing component within the network, connecting various segments. It features three physical interfaces: 'eth_to_edge10' (10.200.2.2/30), 'eth_to_leaf3' (10.0.1.1/30), and 'eth_to_leaf6' (10.0.13.1/30). The interfaces connecting to 'leaf' devices ('eth_to_leaf3', 'eth_to_leaf6') are configured with Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000), indicating their role in high-bandwidth inter-router or router-to-access layer connectivity. The presence of a gateway IP 10.200.2.1 suggests a connection to an 'edge' network. This router is explicitly part of a redundant core infrastructure, implying high availability.",
    "rating": 90,
    "rating_explanation": "As a 'Redundant L3 Core' router, this device is a critical part of the network's backbone. Its failure would severely impact inter-VLAN routing, external connectivity, and overall network performance. The 'redundant' designation implies it's part of a high-availability setup, but its individual importance remains very high. Jumbo frames on leaf connections suggest it handles significant internal network traffic, making it a high-impact component.",
