    "title": "Storage Leaf Switches",
    "summary": "This community consists of two redundant Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, Storage Leaf 01 and Storage Leaf 02, dedicated to a storage cluster. Both switches utilize LACP bonds (bond_tor_storage) for high-availability and increased bandwidth on their downlinks to storage devices. They host VLAN 30 (vlan30_san) with IP addresses 172.16.30.253/24 and 172.16.30.254/24, forming a dedicated Storage Area Network (SAN) segment. Uplinks (eth_uplink_spine1/2) connect these leaf switches to a spine layer (implied by naming and IP ranges 10.0.x.x/30). The consistent use of MTU 9000 across all relevant interfaces indicates support for Jumbo Frames, crucial for high-performance storage traffic. DHCP is disabled on physical interfaces, suggesting static or managed IP assignments.",
    "rating": 90,
    "rating_explanation": "These switches are critical infrastructure for a storage cluster, likely supporting high-performance storage. Any disruption would severely impact data access and application availability. The use of redundancy (two switches, LACP bonds) mitigates some risks, but their central role in data access makes them highly important.",
